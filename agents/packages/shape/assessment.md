# shape — Assessment

Sorted from the 2026-07-13 rereview (solid, 82/100). Most of the 2026-07-02 Approved correctness sweep has landed and is verified in source; what remains is the unlanded tail of that approval (typed round-trip, the path-dependency question), test debt for the landed fixes, and a few small doc/correctness defects.

## Recommended

Sweep-safe: within `@flighthq/shape` (plus its owned header types in `@flighthq/types`, per types-first), no breaking change, no open design decision.

- **Land the approved typed round-trip (`shapeGraphicsData.ts`).** `getShapeGraphicsData(source): readonly ShapeGraphicsRecord[]`, `forEachShapeCommand(source, visitor)`, `appendShapeGraphicsData(shape, records)` — plus the `ShapeGraphicsRecord` discriminated union in `@flighthq/types` keyed by `ShapeCommandKey` over `ShapeCommandRegistry`. Document the walk's allocation contract truthfully (the prior bundle's "does not allocate" comment was false). Already covered by the 2026-07-02 Approved line; it simply never landed in this tree.
- **Add `drawTriangles` to `ShapeCommandRegistry`.** The vocabulary emits the key and bounds/fill handle it, but the header registry lacks the entry, so `ShapeCommandKey` excludes it and a typed hit-test handler for it cannot be declared. Tuple: `[vertices: number[], indices: number[] | null, uvtData: number[] | null, culling: TriangleCulling]`.
- **Backfill tests for the landed 2026-07-02 fixes.** Bounds: cubic-extrema (curve bulging past its hull), per-span stroke expansion (two thicknesses), `drawTriangles` vertex sweep, `drawPath` verb decoding. Fill: `drawPath` winding carried into `ShapeFillRegion.path.winding`, `drawTriangles`-with-uvtData → non-solid. The fixes are currently verified only by source reading.
- **Fix the false `enableShapeHitTesting` doc comment.** The header claims a pen-path point-in-polygon handler is registered; only the four primitive handlers are. Correct the comment (adding the handler itself is a design item — see Backlog).
- **Fix the round-rect hit-test radius truncation.** `((v / 2) | 0 || v / 2)` integer-truncates corner radii ≥ 2 (ellipseWidth 5 → radius 2, not 2.5). Replace with plain `v / 2`; the existing clamp already bounds it.
- **Manifest hygiene: `@flighthq/geometry` dependency.** Used only by `shape.test.ts` (`createRectangle`). Move to the slot `packages:check` prescribes for shipped-test-only imports, and verify with `npm run packages:check`.
- **Refresh `status.md` on next ingest.** The 2026-06-25 top entry describes a lean tree missing the arc/polygon surface; `06a0c480` recovered it the same day. (For the ingest pass — this cell's reviewer does not edit status.)

## Backlog

Parked — each with the reason it is not sweep-safe.

- **Decision #4 follow-through (path dependency / shared curve constants).** _Parked — needs a superseding ruling._ `PathCommand` was homed in `@flighthq/types` instead of adding the path dependency, but KAPPA is still duplicated and shape's and path's copies differ by a digit (path's `0.5522847498308936` looks like the typo). Fixing the divergence touches `@flighthq/path`; deciding the constant's home is a charter call. Surface to Open directions.
- **Pen-state home for `appendShapeArcTo`.** _Parked — API-shape decision._ The per-call O(n) buffer rescan wants a runtime pen slot or an explicit pen parameter; either changes the authoring contract.
- **Whole-shape / pen-path fill hit-testing.** _Parked — design + cross-package._ A `hitTestShapePoint` composing `getShapeFillRegions` with path's winding containment spans the shape/path seam; per-command polygon handlers alone need a containment kernel shape shouldn't own.
- **Stroke hit-testing.** _Parked — cross-package per Decision #2._ Composes shape style data + path stroke-outline expansion.
- **Miter-aware stroke bounds.** _Parked — needs the same stroke-geometry seam._ Per-point `strokeHalf` under-covers miter spikes; a correct term needs joint geometry (path's domain).
- **Scale-9 distortion behavior.** _Parked — Open direction #1._
- **Robustness policy (degenerate radii, odd-length polygon arrays, NaN).** _Parked — Open direction #3; needs blessing before guards/`explain*` are authored._
- **`ShapeCommand.ts` one-concept-per-file split.** _Parked — types-layout owner._
- **Graphics parity holes (`beginShaderFill`/`lineShaderStyle`, quads/tiles).** _Parked — charter non-goals/deferred, cross-package._
- **Rust `flighthq-shape` crate.** _Parked — cross-worktree; Open direction #4._

## Approved

- [2026-07-02 · picked] Correctness sweep: exact cubic bounds, per-span stroke bounds, drawTriangles in bounds/fill, honor drawPath winding, remove getShapeBounds aliasing comment, typed readback/round-trip (shapeGraphicsData.ts + ShapeGraphicsRecord type), add path dependency
